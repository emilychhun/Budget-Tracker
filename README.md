I know this might not be the perfect README for all projects out there. If your vision of a perfect README.md differs greatly from mine, tell me what you think and we open an issue. If you'd like to contribute,  please do pull requests and make changes as you'd like. In this case, you can create a new file README-yourplatform.md and create the perfect boilerplate for that.
